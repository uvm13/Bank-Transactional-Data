# Introduction
This project analyses daily sales data for a single product at a large retail store, using a simulated dataset. The analysis leverages Databricks, SQL, and Excel to derive actionable business insights, focusing on pricing, profitability, and the impact of promotions.

# Problem Statement
Retailers often struggle to understand how pricing strategies and promotions affect sales and profitability. Without clear metrics and analysis, it is difficult to optimise pricing or identify periods of underperformance.

# Aim of the Project
To develop key sales and profitability metrics, analyse the impact of promotions, and uncover actionable insights that can inform better pricing and sales strategies.

# Objectives
- Calculate daily and average unit sales prices.
- Determine daily and per-unit gross profit percentages.
- Identify and analyse periods of price promotions, including price elasticity of demand.
- Visualise sales and profitability trends over time.
- Highlight key findings and actionable insights from the data.

# Tools Used
- Databricks: For scalable data processing and advanced analytics.
- SQL: For querying, aggregating, and transforming sales data.
- Excel: For data cleaning, calculations, and visualisation.

# Summary of Results
- Average Unit Sales Price: R35.40 per unit (over the entire period).
- Highest Sales Day: 1 March 2014, with R846,678.39 in sales.
- Lowest Sales Day: 14 September 2016, with R20,495.11 in sales.
- Highest Gross Profit % Day: 11 July 2016, with +14.86% gross profit.
- Lowest Gross Profit % Day: 29 November 2015, with -14.86% gross profit.
- Price Elasticity During Promotions: Product is highly price-sensitive; small price drops led to large increases in quantity sold.

# Key Insights
- Sales Trends: Sales show clear peaks and troughs, indicating possible seasonality.
- Profitability: Gross profit percentage fluctuates, with some periods of negative gross profit (losses), often aligning with promotions or price drops.
- Promotions: During promotions, even small price reductions resulted in significant increases in quantity sold, confirming high price sensitivity.
- Variability: Both sales and profitability are highly variable, suggesting the influence of external factors such as seasonality, promotions, or market conditions.
- Actionable Finding: Monitoring and optimizing promotional pricing can significantly boost sales volume, but may impact profitability if not managed carefully.
